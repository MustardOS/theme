# Theme Library
You can find all themes for muOS here. Click on a theme title to download a zip, place that file on your device within `/ARCHIVE`, and use your on-device Archive Manager to install it. Alternatively, you can download all muOS themes as a single installable archive [here](https://github.com/MustardOS/theme/releases/latest/download/@_Complete_Theme_Archive.zip). You can also use this if you simply just want to add any themes you have missed up until this point as well.


All these themes were made by members of the muOS community. Join the community [here](https://discord.gg/muos).
