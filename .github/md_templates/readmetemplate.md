# Theme Library
You can find all themes for muOS here. Click on a theme title to download a zip, place that file on your device within `/ARCHIVE`, and use your on-device Archive Manager to install it. Both the preview image and theme will be installed in this way.

-  [Complete Theme Archive download](https://github.com/MustardOS/theme/releases/latest/download/@_Complete_Theme_Archive.zip). ***Warning! This is quite a big file, currently exceeding 600MB.*** 
 This will download all available muOS themes as a single installable archive, and can update previously installed themes.

- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/muos). All these themes were made by members of the muOS community. Join the community today!

- [combine.zip](https://combine.zip). To prevent having to install lots of individual archives separately, you can combine archives together using this website, to create a customised single archive for multiple themes.

  
> *Some themes have matching folder artwork whilst navigating Explore Content, this is installed separately from themes. To see if a theme has these available, navigate to the specific theme's release page on the [muOS Discord server](https://discord.gg/muos).*
