# Themes
On muOS, you can fully customise the look of your menus on your device! This is achieved with **Themes**. You can make your own themes by following the help pages here, or install some pre-existing ones below. Happy theme-ing!

# Theme Library
You can find all themes for muOS here. Click on a theme title to download a zip, place that file on your device within `/ARCHIVE`, and use your on-device Archive Manager to install it. Alternatively, you can download all muOS themes as a single installable archive [here](https://github.com/MustardOS/theme/releases/latest/download/@_Complete_Theme_Archive.zip).

> *Some themes have matching folder artwork whilst navigating Explore Content, this is installed separately from themes. To see if a theme has these available, navigate to the specific theme's release page on the [muOS Discord server](https://discord.gg/muos).*
