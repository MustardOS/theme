# Themes
On muOS, you can fully customise the look of your menus on your device! This is achieved with **Themes**. You can make your own themes by following the help pages here, or install some pre-existing ones below. Happy theme-ing!

# Theme Library
You can find all themes for muOS here. Click on a theme title to download a zip. Place that file on your device within `MUOS/theme`.

- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/muos). All these themes were made by members of the muOS community. Join the community today!

-  [Complete Theme Archive download](https://github.com/MustardOS/theme/releases/latest/download/@_Complete_Theme_Archive.zip). ***Warning! This is quite a big file, currently exceeding 1GB.*** 
 This will download all available muOS themes as a single installable archive, and can update previously installed themes. Drop this in `/ARCHIVE`, and use your on-device Archive Manager to install it.
  
> *Some themes have matching folder artwork whilst navigating Explore Content, this is installed separately from themes. To see if a theme has these available, navigate to the specific theme's release page on the [muOS Discord server](https://discord.gg/muos).*
